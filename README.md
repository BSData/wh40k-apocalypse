__What's this?__

Fundamalleus Organization created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles. It extends [Warhammer 40,000 Apocalypse](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-apocalypse) and adds missing datasheets from recent releases

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Not Yet! We are working on getting it hosted.

Hopefully, we will eventually have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Now, you have some options:

1. Make sure it is an issue with this repo specifically - bugs with the base repo should be reported [there](https://github.com/BSData/wh40k-apocalypse).

2. [Open issue directly][] (green `New Issue` in upper-right, GitHub account required) - you can track the progress, get notifications, help us by answering possibly follow-up questions and help us better!
