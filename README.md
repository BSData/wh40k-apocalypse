__What's this?__

BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher. If you want
to develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [Getting Started wiki][]

__Okay, nice project. Is it actually working?__ _I just want those files..._

Yeah! We have it hosted on AppSpot. Take a look: [BattleScribe Data on Appspot][]

__I found a bug!__ / *I have another request*

Great, thank you! Now, you have some options:

1. [Report it on AppSpot][] - it's anonymous and no account is needed - on downside, you'll need to manually check on the progress of your issue.

2. [Open issue directly][] (green `New Issue` in upper-right, GitHub account required) - you can track the progress, get notifications, help us by answering possibly follow-up questions and help us better!
